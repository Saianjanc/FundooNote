**FundooNote using Express API**
This is a Node JS Project Repository.

This Repository contains all the files related to Node JS trainning in BridgeLabz.

The FundooNote project is a website for creating and storing notes for individual user.

In this project I have created User Registation and User Login, used Mongo DB as database for storing the user details.

Softwares and tools used are VS Code, Node JS and Express api.
